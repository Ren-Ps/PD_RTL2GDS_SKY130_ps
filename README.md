# Advance Physical Design RTL-to-GDSII using SKY130 technology and OpenLANE for EDA

# PD_RTL2GDS_SKY130_ps
This repo contents learning info and steps followed during the workshop of Advanced Physical Design Using OpenLANE/SKY130. It focuses on the complete ASIC flow approach from RTL2GDS using opensource EDA tools and the PICORV32A which is RISC-V architecture is followed for designing the core.
