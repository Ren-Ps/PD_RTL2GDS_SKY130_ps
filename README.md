# Advance Physical Design RTL-to-GDSII using SKY130 technology and OpenLANE for EDA

# PD_RTL2GDS_SKY130_ps
This repo contents learning info and steps followed during the workshop of Advanced Physical Design Using OpenLANE/SKY130. It focuses on the complete ASIC flow approach from RTL2GDS using opensource EDA tools and the PICORV32A which is RISC-V architecture is followed for designing the core.

# About RTL to GDSII Flow
RTL (Register tranfer level) to GDSII (Graphic Data Stream) flow consists of the complete set of steps required to create a file which could be sent for tapeout. The RTL code is synthesized and optimised. After sysnthesis of the code, PnR, floor and power planning is done while keeping in check the timing constraints. At the end GDSII file is written out.
The complete flow consists of following steps:
* Writting RTL
* Synthesis
* STA (Static Timing Analysis)
* DFT (Design for Testability) 
* Floorplanning
* Placement
* CTS (Clock Tree Synthesis)
* Routing
* GDSII Streaming

# SKYWater130 PDK
It is a Open source PDK (Process Design Kit) which is released by the collabration of Google and SkyWater Technologies foundary. Currently this technology has a target node of 130 nm. It is open to everyone and can be accessed at [SkyWater Open Source PDK](https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk). This PDK is extremely flexible as it provides many optional featurs as standard features. Hence it povide designers with wide range of design choice. 

# OpenLANE
It is an open-source VLSI flow created using open source tools. Basically it is collection of various scripts which invoke and execute these tools in right sequence, modifies inputs and outputs and gives an organised results.

# Day 1 - Inception of open-source EDA, OpenLANE and Sky130 PDK
  ## How to talk to computers
  ### IC Terminologies
  In the complete flow to this RTL2GDS physical designing there are lot of terminologies one comes across. Some of these terms are described below.
  * Package - ICs are basically presents as packages. These packages are materials which contains the semiconductor device. These packages protect the device from damage. these are of various kind. An example of QFN-48 (Quad Falt No-Leads) with 48 pins is taken here.
